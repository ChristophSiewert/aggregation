A Python code for generating 3D models of aggregate 
and rimed snowflakes.

Requires NumPy and SciPy.

You can install the package by running 
```
python setup.py install
```
in the repository root directory.

A more thorough documentation will follow later. Currently, you can 
find some examples in the notebook at [notebooks/Rimed_aggregates.ipynb](notebooks/Rimed_aggregates.ipynb). You can view this by going to the notebooks directory and running
```
jupyter notebook Rimed_aggregates.ipynb
```
(you need jupyter installed to do this).
